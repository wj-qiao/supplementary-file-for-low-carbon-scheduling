# supplementary-file-for-low-carbon-scheduling

Supplementary files for the paper entitled "Low-Carbon Scheduling of Coupled Traffic-Power Networks with a Uniform Carbon Pricing Scheme".

The following files are included:

1. **Topology** of *Test System 1* and *Test System 2*;
2. **Data** of *Test System 1* and *Test System 2*, which can also be found here: [*Test System 1*](https://figshare.com/s/cf252be7417835063249), [*Test System 2*](https://figshare.com/s/1b7a0d753403978d1c17);
3. **Model** of carbon pricing method adopted as • *Method 1* and • *Method 2*;
4. **Explanation** of the **extra payment problem** (and also of • *Method 1*);
5. **Model** and **Algorithm** of the accuracy-aware adaptive piece-wise linearization (AAPWL) method adopted as • *Case C*;
6. **Sensitivity analysis**, which is conducted on *Test System 2*. The impact of EV penetration level on scheduling results and the charging price (i.e., the energy-carbon integrated price, ECIP for short) design is investigated.
