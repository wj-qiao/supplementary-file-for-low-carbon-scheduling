# supplementary-file-for-low-carbon-scheduling

Supplementary files for the paper entitled "Enhancing Emission Reduction of Coupled Power-Traffic Networks Based on Energy-Carbon Integrated Prices".

**Due to the page limitation, the topology, data are provided here. Besides, another test system is provided for testing as well, which may be supplemented in the paper later if necessary.**

The following files are included:

1. **Topology** of *Test System 1* and *Test System 2*;
2. **Data** of *Test System 1* and *Test System 2*, which can also be found here: [*Test System 1*](https://figshare.com/s/cf252be7417835063249), [*Test System 2*](https://figshare.com/s/1b7a0d753403978d1c17);
3. **Model** of carbon pricing method adopted as • *Method 1* and • *Method 2*;
4. **Explanation** of the **extra payment problem** (and also of • *Method 1*);
5. **Model** and **Algorithm** of the accuracy-aware adaptive piece-wise linearization (AAPWL) method adopted as • *Case C*;
6. **Sensitivity analysis**, which is conducted on *Test System 2*. The impact of EV penetration level on scheduling results and the charging price (i.e., the energy-carbon integrated price, ECIP for short) design is investigated, and the sensitivity analysis of the carbon tax is supplemented;
7. **Appendix**, which is a game theoretic analysis of PDNO and TNO, which is not included in the main paper due to the page limitation, whereas, it will be attached to the paper later.
